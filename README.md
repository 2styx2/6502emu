# 6502 CPU Emu

## Arch
 - Address Space 0x0000 - 0xFFFF
  - 0x0000 - 0x00FF = Zero Page
  - 0x0100 - 0x01FF = System stack (Can not be relocated)

# Why?
 - I wanted to emulate the NES system
 - Also its the 50th Anniversary!!
# TODO
 - For future i could make multi-system 
 - Add unit test 
 - Maybe create a debug mode to see value of certain parts of mem
